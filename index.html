    <h2>About Tomb of Light</h2>
    <p>
        Tomb of Light is not just an NFT project; it is a living, digital family tree where your legacy finds a permanent home.
        Founded by Larry Robinson with Jennifer Wood, Leon Floyd, Marquis Floyd, and Tony Floyd, we are pioneering a space where
        families can trace their lineage, preserve their stories, and connect past, present, and future on the blockchain.
        No more searching or fragmented histories—Tomb of Light ensures your family's essence and values are secured forever,
        using NFTs and blockchain technology to transform your lineage into a timeless digital vault where generations find
        their place and purpose for eternity.
