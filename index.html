    <h3>What You Get</h3>
    <p>With Tomb of Light, you receive a beautifully designed, interactive family NFT that grows as your family grows. By zooming into your portrait, your children and their stories appear inside. When your children inherit the NFT, it expands to include their children, forming a living, visual family tree that links generations together forever on the blockchain. This creates an eternal, interactive record of your family's legacy that can never be lost or destroyed.</p>
